This is an example of a module containing a custom type and a single provider implementation. If you only plan on having a single provider, no need to use this method. See the 'append' module instead.

This example was taken from:

http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/puppet/wiki/Development_Complete_Resource_Example


Usage:

$ puppet apply --verbose --modulepath /tmp/puppet_custom_type_example \
simplefile/manifests/init.pp

Add the --debug flag for more output.
