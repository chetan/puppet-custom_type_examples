This is an example of a module containing a custom type with no provider implementation. If you don't need multiple backends, go ahead and use this method.

This example was taken from:

http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/1/wiki/Development_Practical_Types


Usage:

$ puppet apply --verbose --modulepath /tmp/puppet_custom_type_example \
append/manifests/init.pp

Add the --debug flag for more output.
